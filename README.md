## 🚀 Features

*   **Modern UI/UX:** Faithfully recreates the familiar and efficient Gmail interface.
*   **Fully Responsive:** Works seamlessly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
*   **Interactive Components:**
    *   Sidebar navigation (Inbox, Starred, Snoozed, Sent, Drafts)
    *   Email list view
    *   Compose email modal
    *   Search functionality (UI)
*   **Clean Inbox:**
    *   Visual representation of unread/read emails.
    *   Sender, subject, and preview text.
*   **Built with Vanilla Tech Stack:** Utilizes plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for fundamental understanding and performance.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

This is a front-end project built with:

*   **HTML5:** For the semantic structure of the application.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, including Flexbox/Grid for layout and modern design.
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** For adding interactivity and dynamic behavior.

## 📦 Installation & Setup

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Rakeshln222/gmail-web-site.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```bash
    cd gmail-web-site
    ```
3.  **Open the project**
    *   You can simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
    *   For a better development experience (e.g., live reload), use a local server. If you have Python installed:
        ```bash
        # For Python 3.x
        python -m http.server 8000
        ```
        Then, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:8000`.

## 🎯 Usage

This is a **front-end prototype**. It demonstrates the user interface and client-side interactions of Gmail.

*   **Viewing:** Navigate through the sidebar to different sections (Inbox, Sent, etc.).
*   **Composing:** Click the "Compose" button to open the email composition window.
*   **Searching:** Use the search bar at the top (the UI is functional, but it does not connect to a real email backend).
*   **Responsive Test:** Try resizing your browser window or opening it on a mobile device to see the responsive layout in action.
